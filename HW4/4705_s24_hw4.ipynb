Following (Collobert et al. 2011) and others, we will treat this problem as a sequence-labeling task. For each input token, the system will predict a B-I-O tag, as illustrated in the following example: \n",

    "### Overview of the Approach\n",

    "The model we will train is pretty straightforward. Essentially, we will just encode the sentence with BERT, then take the contextualized embedding for each token and feed it into a classifier to predict the corresponding tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are only working on argument identification and labeling (not predicate identification), it is essentially that we tell the model where the predicate is. This can be accomplished in various ways. The approach we will choose here repurposes Bert's *segment embeddings*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that BERT is trained on two input sentences, seperated by [SEP], and on a next-sentence-prediction objective (in addition to the masked LM objective). To help BERT comprehend which sentence a given token belongs to, the original BERT uses a segment embedding, using A for the first sentene, and B for the second sentence 2. \n",
    "Because we are labeling only a single sentence at a time, we can use the segment embeddings to indicate the predicate position instead: The predicate is labeled as segment B (1) and all other tokens will be labeled as segment A (0). \n",
